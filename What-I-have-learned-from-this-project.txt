1. Create react app with vite. Visit [https://vite.dev/guide/] for more detail
--> npm init vite @latest . -- --template react OR npm create vite@latest
--> npm install
--> npm run dev

2. Install tailwindcss with Vite. Visit [https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite] for more detail
--> npm install -D tailwindcss@3 postcss autoprefixer
--> npx tailwindcss init -p
--> Go to tailwind.config.js file and add "./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}", to content.
--> Add @tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities; to index.css

3. Config color in tailwind.config.js
--> Defining all your color tokens in one place guarantees that every component references the same values, making a 
global color change as simple as editing a single line in your config.
--> Tailwind scans only the classes you actually use (from your defined palette), so unused default colors are omitted entirely, keeping your CSS bundle minimal 
--> By pruning unused styles at build time, Tailwind’s new engine compiles your trimmed palette significantly faster—up to 5× faster full builds and 100× faster incremental builds

4.!!! [ERROR 1] 
When @apply a new tailwind config in index.css I have met the error of color class which I config 
in tailwind.config.js
--> All the color in the tailwind.config.js must be in the "color: {},"
--> Try to stop the server and npm run dev after any config to tailwind.
